Instructions : 
Step 1 
Open the info.mxi file in Notepad++ (if you don't have it then download it at https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
Step 2
Copy the Flash Extension Template folder and rename the copy to the name of your extension.
Step 3 
Read this pretty cool guide on making extensions at https://ajarproductions.com/blog/2011/02/08/creating-flash-extensions-pt1/ (only make jsfl commands), also, it requires Adobe Animate (Not Animate CC and/or Flash CC, rather the ones from Flash 8 and up at https://animatearchive.neocities.org). Make a new Flash JavaScript file (jsfl). I use Flash CS6, and Macromedia and CS versions are free due to them being abandonware) Make sure to test the .jsfl
Step 4
Once you're done, open the .mxi and rename the following : 
Your Name Here = Your name!
Information goes here = The description
NAME HERE = The name of your extension.
NAME OF JSFL = The name of your .jsfl.
And of course, save, then rename info.mxi to the name of your extension.
Step 5
Open the .mxi with <b>Macromedia Extension Manager</b> if you want it to work with Flash 8 or Flash 9/CS3 (If you installed Flash CS3) and up (If you installed Flash 8), or <b>Adobe Extension Manager</b> if you want it to work with Flash 10 (Flash CS4) and up. Now click save on the popup that asks you to save the .mxp/.zxp and then try installing the mxp/zxp. If it works and you click Accept, then Congratulations! You've installed your extension! Now go to the menu Commands > Your name of the extension, and then you're done!
