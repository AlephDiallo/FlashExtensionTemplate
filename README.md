Instructions : <br />
Step 1 <br />
Open the info.mxi file in Notepad++ (if you don't have it then download it at https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)<br />
Step 2 <br />
Copy the Flash Extension Template folder and rename the copy to the name of your extension.<br />
Step 3 <br />
Read this pretty cool guide on making extensions at https://ajarproductions.com/blog/2011/02/08/creating-flash-extensions-pt1/ (only make jsfl commands), also, it requires Adobe Animate (Not Animate CC and/or Flash CC, rather the ones from Flash 8 and up at https://animatearchive.neocities.org). Make a new Flash JavaScript file (jsfl). I use Flash CS6, and Macromedia and CS versions are free due to them being abandonware) Make sure to test the .jsfl<br />
Step 4<br />
Once you're done, open the .mxi and rename the following : <br />
Your Name Here = Your name!<br />
Information goes here = The description<br />
NAME HERE = The name of your extension.<br />
NAME OF JSFL = The name of your .jsfl.<br />
And of course, save, then rename info.mxi to the name of your extension.<br />
Step 5<br />
Open the .mxi with <b>Macromedia Extension Manager</b> if you want it to work with Flash 8 or Flash 9/CS3 (If you installed Flash CS3) and up (If you installed Flash 8), or <b>Adobe Extension Manager</b> if you want it to work with Flash 10 (Flash CS4) and up. Now click save on the popup that asks you to save the .mxp/.zxp and then try installing the mxp/zxp. If it works and you click Accept, then Congratulations! You've installed your extension! Now go to the menu Commands > Your name of the extension, and then you're done!<br />
